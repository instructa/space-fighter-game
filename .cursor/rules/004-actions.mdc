# Actions Guidelines

## Purpose

- Actions are centralized functions that modify the ECS world in predictable ways.
- They keep spawn/remove/update logic out of components and systems, providing a single place for entity manipulation.

## Core Principles

1. Single Entry Points  
   Write all creation, destruction, or major trait updates in these functions.  
2. Pure ECS Focus  
   Do not add external side effects or UI manipulation.  
3. Descriptive Names  
   Use clear names like `spawnEnemy()`, `applyDamage()`, or `destroyEntity()`.
     
## Avoid

- Do not add direct DOM or React manipulations in actions.
- Do not handle input events or animations here; keep it purely for ECS state changes.
- Avoid side effects that do not relate to ECS data. Keep them simple and testable.
