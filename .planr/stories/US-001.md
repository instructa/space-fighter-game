# User Story: US-001 - Control Spacecraft Movement

## Status: DONE  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a player, I want to control my spacecraft's movement using WASD keys and Space for thrust to navigate space effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Pressing W applies forward thrust relative to the spacecraft's orientation.
- [x] Pressing S applies backward thrust relative to the spacecraft's orientation.
- [x] Pressing A applies leftward thrust relative to the spacecraft's orientation.
- [x] Pressing D applies rightward thrust relative to the spacecraft's orientation.
- [x] Pressing Space increases the spacecraft's speed by applying additional thrust (e.g., +5 units per second squared) in the direction faced.
- [x] Position and velocity update each frame with no noticeable input delay.

## General Tasks:

- [x] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Tests are written and passing
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Performance considerations addressed
- [x] Security considerations addressed
- [x] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [x] Create InputSystem for keyboard input - Status: DONE
- [x] Implement MovementSystem with Newtonian physics - Status: DONE
- [x] Add thrust traits for different directions - Status: DONE
- [x] Connect input to movement system - Status: DONE

## Estimation: 3 story points  
*(Note: One step is 1 story point, which equals 1 day of work for a senior developer)*

## Developer Notes:
*(Note: Add here important learnings, necessary fixes, all other devs need to know to proceed)*

- Implemented Newtonian physics for realistic zero-gravity movement
- Controls are responsive with no noticeable delay
- Input and movement systems are separate for proper ECS architecture
- Used relative direction vectors for WASD controls
- Added a boost multiplier of 5x for Space key to provide significant thrust
- Set damping to 0.99 to maintain velocity persistence in zero-gravity
- Integrated with existing mouse rotation system for full 3D control
- The movement system chain is: pollInput → convertInputToMovement → applyForce → limitSpeed → moveEntities
