# Component Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Components only render visuals; use `useTraitEffect` to reflect trait changes.
- Use functional components for R3F with ECS data read via hooks.
- Keep components strictly presentational. All game logic should reside in systems.
- Use `useTraitEffect(entity, Trait, callback)` to reflect ECS changes on mesh references.
- Always use `useCallback` for ref initialization functions to maintain referential stability

## Asset Loading and Cleanup

- Use React Three Fiber helpers like `useGLTF` or `useTexture` for loading models or textures.
- Dispose geometry and materials in a cleanup function if creating many dynamic objects over time.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not place ECS or game logic in React state.
- Do not mutate ECS traits directly from a component. Use systems or actions.
- Do not rely on `useFrame` for core game logic; reserve it for minor visual effects only.
