# VIBER3D SPACEWARS - GAME CONTROLS

## SPACECRAFT MOVEMENT
- W / Up Arrow: Forward thrust
- S / Down Arrow: Backward thrust/brake
- A / Left Arrow: Strafe left
- D / Right Arrow: Strafe right
- SPACE: Boost (5x forward thrust)
- Q: Roll left

## GAME CONTROLS
- MOUSE CLICK: Lock mouse pointer for rotation control

## NOTES
- The game uses realistic Newtonian physics in zero-gravity
- Objects in motion stay in motion unless countered with thrust
- Rotation is independent from movement direction
- To stop completely, apply thrust in the opposite direction of your movement
