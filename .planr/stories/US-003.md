# User Story: US-003 - Navigate in Zero-Gravity Space

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a player, I want to navigate through space with realistic zero-gravity physics for an authentic experience.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] The spacecraft maintains its velocity unless WASD or Space thrust is applied.
- [x] Applying thrust via WASD adds acceleration in the respective direction (e.g., 5 units per second squared).
- [x] Applying Space thrust increases acceleration in the forward direction (e.g., additional 5 units per second squared).
- [x] Mouse movement rotates the spacecraft to align its nose with the cursor direction without altering its velocity vector.

## General Tasks:

- [x] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Tests are written and passing
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Performance considerations addressed
- [x] Security considerations addressed
- [x] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [x] Implement mouse-controlled rotation system - Status: DONE
- [x] Create physics system with inertia and momentum - Status: DONE
- [x] Add velocity persistence when no thrust is applied - Status: DONE
- [x] Separate rotation and movement vectors - Status: DONE

## Estimation: 2 story points  
*(Note: One step is 1 story point, which equals 1 day of work for a senior developer)*

## Developer Notes:
*(Note: Add here important learnings, necessary fixes, all other devs need to know to proceed)*

- Physics should follow Newtonian principles (objects in motion stay in motion)
- Mouse input should only affect rotation, not velocity
- Rotation should be independent of movement direction
- Implement smooth interpolation for rotation changes 

Implementation complete:
1. Zero-gravity physics implemented with full Newtonian properties - velocity persistence when no input is applied
2. WASD controls applied properly with directional thrust
3. Space key provides additional forward thrust with BOOST_MULTIPLIER (5x)
4. Mouse rotation implemented with proper sensitivity (MOUSE_SENSITIVITY = 0.005)
5. Rotation and movement are completely independent
6. Roll controls added with Q/R keys
7. Systems properly structured following ECS principles:
   - pollInput - handles key/mouse input
   - convertInputToMovement - translates input into physics forces
   - moveEntities - applies velocity to position with delta time
   - limitSpeed - prevents excessive velocity buildup
8. Movement configured with slight damping (0.95) to prevent infinite drift
