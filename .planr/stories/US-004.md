# User Story: US-004 - Avoid or Destroy Asteroids

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a player, I want to avoid or destroy asteroids in my path to survive and score points.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Asteroids spawn with random velocities (e.g., 1-3 units per second) and directions.
- [ ] Colliding with an asteroid reduces spacecraft health (e.g., 10 damage points).
- [ ] Shooting an asteroid reduces its health (e.g., 20 damage per hit); when health reaches zero, it is destroyed and awards 50 points.

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Create AsteroidSpawnSystem for random placement - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement AsteroidMovementSystem for physics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create collision handling between spacecraft and asteroids - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement health system for asteroids - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add scoring system for destroyed asteroids - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 3 story points  
*(Note: One step is 1 story point, which equals 1 day of work for a senior developer)*

## Developer Notes:
*(Note: Add here important learnings, necessary fixes, all other devs need to know to proceed)*

- Asteroids should have various sizes affecting damage and points
- Use object pooling for efficient asteroid spawning
- Consider using 3D models with appropriate collision meshes
- Implement visual feedback for asteroid damage
