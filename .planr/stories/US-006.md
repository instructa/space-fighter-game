# User Story: US-006 - Handle Multiple Enemy Shots

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a player, I want the game to manage multiple enemy projectiles effectively to maintain challenge and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Up to 10 projectiles can exist simultaneously without frame rate drops below 60 FPS.
- [ ] Each projectile is tracked independently for collision with the spacecraft or asteroids.

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Create ProjectilePoolSystem for efficient projectile management - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement collision detection for multiple projectiles - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add performance optimization for projectile rendering - Status: TODO
- [ ] Develop testing framework for FPS benchmarking - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 2 story points  
*(Note: One step is 1 story point, which equals 1 day of work for a senior developer)*

## Developer Notes:
*(Note: Add here important learnings, necessary fixes, all other devs need to know to proceed)*

- Use object pooling for projectile management
- Consider using instanced meshes for rendering optimization
- Implement spatial partitioning for collision detection
- Add debug visualization for projectile paths and collisions
