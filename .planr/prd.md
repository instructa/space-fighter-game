# Space Combat Game PRD v1.1

This document outlines the requirements for a space combat game where players control a spacecraft in a zero-gravity environment, engage in combat with enemies, navigate through asteroid fields, and experience the game through a third-person camera view. The purpose of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to provide a comprehensive guide for developers to create an immersive and engaging game, focusing on realistic physics, intuitive controls (using WASD and Space), and competitive features like leaderboards.

## 1. Title and Overview

### 1.1 Document Title & Version
Space Combat Game PRD v1.1

### 1.2 Product Summary
The Space Combat Game is a single-player experience set in space, emphasizing spacecraft navigation, enemy combat, and asteroid interactions in a zero-gravity environment. Players control a spacecraft using WASD keys for directional movement, Space for thrust, and mouse inputs for aiming and shooting, engaging in combat with enemy projectiles and avoiding or destroying asteroids. The game features Newtonian physics for realistic movement, rigid body dynamics for collisions, and a smooth third-person camera for immersion. Additional features include online leaderboards for registered users, enhancing competitive play.

## 3. User Stories

### US-001: Control Spacecraft Movement
- Description: As a player, I want to control my spacecraft’s movement using WASD keys and Space for thrust to navigate space effectively.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Pressing W applies forward thrust relative to the spacecraft’s orientation.
  - Pressing S applies backward thrust relative to the spacecraft’s orientation.
  - Pressing A applies leftward thrust relative to the spacecraft’s orientation.
  - Pressing D applies rightward thrust relative to the spacecraft’s orientation.
  - Pressing Space increases the spacecraft’s speed by applying additional thrust (e.g., +5 units per second squared) in the direction faced.
  - Position and velocity update each frame with no noticeable input delay.

### US-002: Shoot Projectiles
- Description: As a player, I want to shoot projectiles at enemies using the left mouse button to engage in combat.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Clicking the left mouse button fires a projectile from the spacecraft’s position in the direction it faces.
  - Projectiles move in straight lines at a constant speed (e.g., 10 units per second).
  - Projectiles collide with enemies or asteroids, applying damage upon impact.

### US-003: Navigate in Zero-Gravity Space
- Description: As a player, I want to navigate through space with realistic zero-gravity physics for an authentic experience.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - The spacecraft maintains its velocity unless WASD or Space thrust is applied.
  - Applying thrust via WASD adds acceleration in the respective direction (e.g., 5 units per second squared).
  - Applying Space thrust increases acceleration in the forward direction (e.g., additional 5 units per second squared).
  - Mouse movement rotates the spacecraft to align its nose with the cursor direction without altering its velocity vector.

### US-004: Avoid or Destroy Asteroids
- Description: As a player, I want to avoid or destroy asteroids in my path to survive and score points.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Asteroids spawn with random velocities (e.g., 1-3 units per second) and directions.
  - Colliding with an asteroid reduces spacecraft health (e.g., 10 damage points).
  - Shooting an asteroid reduces its health (e.g., 20 damage per hit); when health reaches zero, it is destroyed and awards 50 points.

### US-005: Smooth Camera Follow
- Description: As a player, I want the camera to follow my spacecraft smoothly for an immersive view.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - The camera positions at a fixed offset (e.g., 5 units behind) the spacecraft.
  - Camera movement uses interpolation (e.g., lerp with 0.1 factor) for smooth transitions.
  - The camera rotates to match the spacecraft’s orientation each frame.

### US-006: Handle Multiple Enemy Shots
- Description: As a player, I want the game to manage multiple enemy projectiles effectively to maintain challenge and performance.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Up to 10 projectiles can exist simultaneously without frame rate drops below 60 FPS.
  - Each projectile is tracked independently for collision with the spacecraft or asteroids.

### US-007: Repair or Upgrade Spacecraft
- Description: As a player, I want to repair or upgrade my spacecraft to enhance survivability and performance.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Repair options restore health (e.g., 50 health points at designated zones).
  - Upgrades (e.g., +2 speed to Space thrust, +10 damage) are available via collectibles or points.
  - Visual indicators (e.g., new thrusters) reflect upgrades in gameplay.

### US-008: User Registration and Login
- Description: As a player, I want to register and log in to save progress and access leaderboards for a personalized experience.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Registration form accepts username and password, creating a unique account.
  - Login authenticates credentials within 2 seconds.
  - Logged-in users can save progress and submit scores to the leaderboard.

### US-009: View Leaderboard
- Description: As a player, I want to view the leaderboard to compare my performance with others.

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Game ends when health reaches zero, displaying a game over screen.
  - If logged in, the current score submits to the leaderboard automatically.
  - Options to restart or return to the main menu appear within 2 seconds.

### US-011: Pause and Resume Game

  - Pressing Esc again resumes the game from the exact state within 1 second.

### US-012: Enemy AI Shooting

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Enemies fire projectiles toward the spacecraft’s position every 2-3 seconds.
  - Projectiles move at 8 units per second and deal 15 damage on impact.
  - Enemy aim adjusts based on the player’s current position.

### US-013: Score Points
- Description: As a player, I want to score points by destroying enemies and asteroids to track my progress.
