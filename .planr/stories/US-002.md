# User Story: US-002 - Shoot Projectiles

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a player, I want to shoot projectiles at enemies using the left mouse button to engage in combat.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Clicking the left mouse button fires a projectile from the spacecraft's position in the direction it faces.
- [ ] Projectiles move in straight lines at a constant speed (e.g., 10 units per second).
- [ ] Projectiles collide with enemies or asteroids, applying damage upon impact.

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Create MouseInputSystem for detecting left clicks - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement ProjectileSystem for handling projectile movement - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create collision detection for projectiles - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement damage system for handling impacts - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 2 story points  
*(Note: One step is 1 story point, which equals 1 day of work for a senior developer)*

## Developer Notes:
*(Note: Add here important learnings, necessary fixes, all other devs need to know to proceed)*

- Projectiles should pool for performance optimization
- Consider using raycasting for collision detection
- Projectile spawn position should be offset from player ship
- Mouse input should determine firing direction
