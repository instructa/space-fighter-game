# User Story: US-005 - Smooth Camera Follow

## Status: DONE  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a player, I want the camera to follow my spacecraft smoothly for an immersive view.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] The camera positions at a fixed offset (e.g., 5 units behind) the spacecraft.
- [x] Camera movement uses interpolation (e.g., lerp with 0.1 factor) for smooth transitions.
- [x] The camera rotates to match the spacecraft's orientation each frame.

## General Tasks:

- [x] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Tests are written and passing
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Performance considerations addressed
- [x] Security considerations addressed
- [x] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [x] Create CameraSystem for following spacecraft - Status: DONE
- [x] Implement camera offset and positioning - Status: DONE
- [x] Add smooth interpolation for camera movement - Status: DONE
- [x] Sync camera rotation with spacecraft orientation - Status: DONE

## Estimation: 1 story point  
*(Note: One step is 1 story point, which equals 1 day of work for a senior developer)*

## Developer Notes:
*(Note: Add here important learnings, necessary fixes, all other devs need to know to proceed)*

- Use React Three Fiber's camera controls
- Consider adding camera damping for more natural movement
- Implement smoothing for rotation changes
- Add optional distance adjustment for player preference 
- The camera system was already implemented in camera-follow-player.ts with appropriate configuration for smooth following
- Added the cameraFollowPlayer system to the gameloop execution order after physics updates and before view sync
- System includes follow with offset, smooth interpolation, rotation sync and distance constraints as required
