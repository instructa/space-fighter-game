# User Story: US-012 - Enemy AI Shooting

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a player, I want enemies to shoot at me to provide a challenging combat experience.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Enemies fire projectiles toward the spacecraft's position every 2-3 seconds.

- [ ] Enemy aim adjusts based on the player's current position.

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Create EnemyAISystem for targeting logic - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement enemy projectile firing mechanism - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add aiming prediction based on player movement - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create enemy projectile collision handling - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 3 story points  
*(Note: One step is 1 story point, which equals 1 day of work for a senior developer)*

## Developer Notes:
*(Note: Add here important learnings, necessary fixes, all other devs need to know to proceed)*

- Use leading targeting for more challenging enemies
- Implement difficulty scaling for fire rate and accuracy
- Add visual indicators for enemy targeting state
- Consider enemy variety with different firing patterns
- Optimize by disabling AI for offscreen enemies
