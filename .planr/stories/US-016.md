# User Story: US-016 - Debug Performance Metrics View

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a developer, I want to see real-time performance metrics (FPS, memory usage, etc.) displayed on screen so that I can monitor and optimize game performance during development.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Display current FPS (frames per second) counter
- [ ] Show memory usage statistics 
- [ ] Display entity count metrics (total entities, active systems)
- [ ] Include render-specific metrics (draw calls, triangle count)
- [ ] Make debug view toggleable (default ON during development)
- [ ] Position debug overlay in a non-intrusive corner of the screen
- [ ] Ensure debug view doesn't significantly impact performance
- [ ] Add color-coding for performance indicators (green/yellow/red)

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Create Debug Metrics System
   1. - [ ] Implement FPS calculation
   2. - [ ] Track memory usage metrics
   3. - [ ] Implement entity counting
   4. - [ ] Gather R3F renderer statistics
   
2. - [ ] Create Debug UI Component
   1. - [ ] Design non-intrusive UI layout
   2. - [ ] Implement toggle functionality
   3. - [ ] Add conditional color-coding based on thresholds

## ECS Implementation Tasks:

- [ ] Traits: Define `HasDebugMetrics` trait to store performance data
- [ ] Systems: Create `DebugMetricsSystem` to gather and update metrics each frame
- [ ] Actions: Add toggle action to show/hide debug view
- [ ] Renderer: Create React component for displaying metrics with proper styling
- [ ] Integration: Add system to frameloop.ts with high priority (early update)
- [ ] Startup: Initialize debug metrics entity with default ON state
- [ ] Testing: Verify performance impact is minimal and readings are accurate

## Estimation: 2 story points

## Developer Notes:

- We should collect metrics using existing React Three Fiber hooks where possible
- Consider using r3f-perf library as alternative if custom implementation is too complex
- Debug view should be toggleable via keyboard shortcut (default: F3)
- Performance thresholds to consider:
  * FPS: >55 (green), 30-55 (yellow), <30 (red)
  * Memory: Establish baselines during testing
  * Draw calls: <100 (green), 100-500 (yellow), >500 (red)
